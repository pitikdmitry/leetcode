'''
Given a binary tree, find its maximum depth.

The maximum depth is the number of nodes along the longest path from the root node down to the farthest leaf node.

Note: A leaf is a node with no children.

Example:

Given binary tree [3,9,20,null,null,15,7],

# Definition for a binary tree node.


class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, x):
        self.val = x
        self.left = None
        self.right = None


class Solution:
    def maxDepth(self, root: TreeNode) -> int:
        if root is None:
            return 0

        d_1 = self.maxDepth(root.left)
        d_2 = self.maxDepth(root.right)
        return max(d_1, d_2) + 1
